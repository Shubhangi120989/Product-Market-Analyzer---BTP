        "ai_response": "The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, while highly regarded for its features and capabilities, has several performance issues commonly reported by users:\n\n1. **Overheating**: Several users report that the S24 Ultra gets hot during normal usage, such as video calls, Instagram browsing, and YouTube watching. This issue is attributed to poor thermal management in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset (Source: [S24 Ultra: does it get hot?](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/19f342u/s24_ultra_does_it_get_hot/)).\n\n2. **Game Crashes**: Users have noted frequent crashes in games like Pok\u00e9mon GO, with some reporting up to seven crashes per hour. This issue seems to be related to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and not an isolated problem with individual units (Source: [Games crashing on S24 Ultra](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1alidrc/games_crashing_on_s24_ultra_likely_to_return_the/)).\n\n3. **Battery Drain**: Some users have experienced significant battery drain, especially with the Exynos 2400 chipset. This issue is more noticeable in areas with poor cell reception (Source: [Samsung Galaxy S24 plus exynos 2400, long term review](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24/comments/1i6g5cl/samsung_galaxy_s24_plus_exynos_2400_long_term/)).\n\n4. **Display Uniformity**: There are reports of poor display uniformity compared to the S23 Ultra, with some users noting a consistent pattern across multiple units (Source: [S24 Ultra (left) vs S23 Ultra (right). Why does the S24 Ultra have a much worse display uniformity than its predecessor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS24Ultra/comments/1aiy2q2/s24_ultra_left_vs_s23_ultra_right_why_does_the/)).\n\n5. **Software Bugs**: Some users have reported occasional UI bugs, such as stuttering when switching rapidly between apps, and minor issues with Spotify controls in the Quick Panel (Source: [S25 Ultra Review After 24 Hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ifilia/s25_ultra_review_after_24_hours/)).\n\n6. **Battery Life Post-Update**: After updating to One UI 7.0, some users have noticed a drop in battery life, with some reporting only 4.5 hours of screen-on time instead of the expected 6.5 hours (Source: [S24 Ultra: One year later](https://www.reddit.com/r/S24Ultra/comments/1mkc03r/s24_ultra_one_year_later/)).\n\n7. **Display Color Issues**: There are reports of dull and washed-out colors on the home screen and app drawer, with a noticeable improvement when viewing content. This issue is believed to be software-related and not hardware-based (Source: [S24 Ultra Dull Display \u2013 Definitive Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/19f6zhs/s24_ultra_dull_display_definitive_post/)).\n\nThese performance issues are significant enough to warrant attention from Samsung and may impact the user experience, particularly for those who rely on their devices for gaming, multimedia, and daily productivity tasks.",

The stability seems to be.... disastrous level](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/199wf7o/3dmark_solar_bay_stress_test_of_galaxy_s24_ultra/)\n\n[In Tech Spurt's 5-day review, he mentioned glitches when gaming and the phone getting quite hot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FYSWIGskxs)\n\n[Battery drain tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYSDMHfVPeU)\n\n\n\n# EDIT &amp; UPDATE\n\n  \nSome S24U users are experiencing overheating issues in situations where it shouldn't happen (having a video call, scrolling istagram, watching youtube, etc).  \n  \nIt's really important to let Samsung know when and how the overheating issues occur through the Samsung Members app. The more reports they receive, the quicker we can expect a resolution. \n\n**Here's the step-by-step guide:**\n\n1. **Open the Samsung Members App**: It's on your phone, or you can download it from the Google Play Store if it's missing.\n2. **Sign In**: Use your Samsung account to log in if you're not already.\n3. **Head to 'Support'**: You'll see this at the bottom of your screen.\n4. **Tap on 'Error Reports'**: Inside 'Support', there's an 'Error Reports' option. Go ahead and select it.\n5. **Choose 'Overheating'**: After selecting 'Error Reports', pick the third option labeled 'Overheating'.\n6. **Handle 'Language not supported' Error**: If you encounter a 'Language not supported' message, just hit 'Cancel' and proceed with your report.\n7. **Detail the Issue**: Mention how frequently the overheating occurs and describe the situation in which it happens. The more details, the better.\n8. **Attach System Logs**: Ensure the 'Send system log data' box is checked to provide Samsung with essential technical insights.\n9. **Submit the Report**: After filling in all the details and attaching the logs, look for the paper plane icon in the top right corner and tap it to send your report.\n\nLet's get reporting! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcf1\nTop comments:\n1.

Just set up my S24 Ultra yesterday and the thermal management is better than anticipated. Transferred 235 GB from my S23 Ultra and it barely heated up \u2013 not sure if it got warmer than my S23U during its first setup, definitely cooler than my old Oppo X3 Pro (Snapdragon 888); that was a heater. The only hiccup so far is the battery drain, but I'm hoping it improves as the phone learns my usage patterns.

I upgraded from an S22 Ultra, and am surprised how much better the S24 Ultra works, feels, and looks.\n\nHowever, games like Pokemon GO constantly crash, often up to 7 times per hour. It's crashed so often that the operating system has asked that I put the game in Deep Sleep. I'd be happier if this was an isolated issue with my phone, but there are lots of reports on Reddit ([example](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22pokemon%20go%22%20s24&amp;t=month)), other forums, and social media.\n\nI have tried:\n\n* Force-closing the app\n* Restarting the phone\n* Clearing app cache\n* Clearing app storage\n* Formatting the phone\n* Installing the Galaxy Store version\n* Installing version within Secure Folder\n* Using and not using Game Booster, with various settings\n* Contacting Niantic, the developer of Pokemon GO\n\nIt seems like this may be a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 issue, as other recently-released phones with this SoC seem to have the same issue. The Pokemon GO game crashes at all times: idle on the home screen, battling in PvP, fighting in a raid, swiping through my storage items, looking through my Pokemon, and even clicking around in settings.\n\nMy return period will end in 2 days, and I guess I'll be returning this phone, unfortunately. If this one issue could be fixed, this $1,419.99 would have been worth it. I've spent over $200 on accessories (e.g., cases, MagSafe products) on the phone, and it's going to cost me some money to return them, so that will be a waste of time and money.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts about this, please do share. If you are also experiencing this issue, please post a comment - even a simple one - so others are aware of how widespread this issue may be. Thank you and take care.\nTop comments:\n1. I don't think it has anything to do with the phone I think the games need to be updated or fixed so it can run well on the phone.\n2.

I'm coming here to crowdsource opinions on which phone to go with next.\n\nFor context; I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy Ao4s(typing this post on it), and I'm really not loving the frequent lag, stuttering, hitching, and just generally slow performance when I try to open a lot of my apps( Snapchat, Reddit, Instagram etc), and that's to say nothing of how leggy and hot the phone gets when I try to run any form of mobile game app. Even opening stuff like the Notes app, SMS messaging app, the Settings menu, the phone just struggles immensely, taking significant time to open and load anything, and I'm fed up of it. The 32GB storage just isn't cutting it for me either personally.\n\nI'd ideally like a new model with a Chipset that offers as close to lag-free performance during both basic operation, using and perusing social media, and even mobile gaming as i can get. \n\nI've been looking at some of the flagship S models(on contract), and the S23 and S24 in particular have caught my eye. I've seen the reviews, and both seem to be generally favourable models( the plus and Ultra versions of each are a hair out of my price range currently). \n\nThere's one other additional wrinkle too;\nI'm not in America currently, so both models would have Exynos chips in them instead of Qualcomm Snapdragon, and I've observed that Exynos' track record has been, uhhhhh, controversial, to say the least lol. Getting a phone shipped over from the US isn't an option for me atm either.\n\nSo with all this in mind, if anyone has any advice or possible insights on which model I should go with, that would be much appreciated, thank you in advance :)\nTop comments:\n1. S23 has the SD 8 gen 2 chip worldwide. The base S23, not the FE keep in mind. The FE has the chip from the S22 and thus inherits the bad thermals and battery life.\n2. Exynos shouldn't be a problem on the S24 but the S23 (which comes with snapdragon worldwide) is really just as good. Buy whichever's cheaper. Just make sure you don't buy the FE.\n3. Maybe you're mistaken. \nS23 comes with a snapdragon 8 gen 2 world wide.

The S-pen feels super cheap compared to the notes pen, the camera isn't really that great (struggles with focus more than the note in certain lighting), the AI is just a gimmick that isn't used because it's a bit janky and not as smooth as shown in their demos (it's a glorified Google search/translate/whatever tool Google already has), bluetooth connectivity keeps getting dropped (never with my note 20 on the same devices) and now this junk wont charge because it detects moisture  in the port that isnt there. I Googled the moisture issue and I'm not the first one with this, its a known issue. For a flagship phone this is absolutely junk and an utter failure of a flagships first year on the market.\n\nI can't believe I am saying this but I actually regret getting this phone. My cousin got the IPhone 16 max pro the same day I got this and that thing is a beast. I'm so let down by samsung with this that I don't even know what to do. I kind wanna migrate to Apple because alteast they have some consistency with thier phones, sure they are all the same with limited improvements between generations but hey, their phones work and always deliver. \n\nYes, i will reach out to customer support in the morning but still I'm utterly let down by \"the best phone on the market\".\nTop comments:\n1. It's not like Apple introduces revolutionary changes to their phones every year either lol. You can switch now, but then as you upgrade to newer iPhones you'll notice the same thing as you do now with Samsung. But if you're a Samsung fan, there's plenty of functionalities you'll miss if you switch. \nI got an iPhone 13 as a company phone in a time when I owned S22+ (they're comparable phones as they came out in the same time). And surely the selfie quality was better on the 13, but there was just SO MUCH little stuff missing.. Like the back button inconsistency, no customization options like One Hand Operarion+, no clipboard in the keyboard, no long screenshots, having to change the notifications on every single app to change their voice/vibrarion... unless you want something very simple. Then go for it.\n2. Buyers remorse, eh?\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1i2hx2h/s24_ultra_failure/\n\n",
            "Chunk 15:\nTitle: S25 Ultra Review After 24 Hours\nSelftext: \nI recently upgraded to the S25 Ultra from my Galaxy S23, despite many reviewers claiming upgrades were only worthwhile from the S22 Ultra or older. After using it fairly extensively the past 24 ish hours, I can confidently say this phone feels like a remarkable and well worth leap forward.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros\n\nStunning Display: Pin-sharp, vivid, and impressively bright.\n\nHigh Performance: Blazing-fast animations, feels smoother than both the S23 and FINALLY iPhone 15 Pro Max/ iPhone's in general.\n\nExcellent Battery: 2\u20134 hours more screen-on time than my S23.\n\nImpressive Camera Setup: Great outdoor detail, smooth lens switching, solid video quality.\n\nImproved Speakers: Loud and bass-rich, especially with Dolby Atmos and Dynamic preset on.\n\nCooler Thermals: Barely heats up on 5G and normal usage compared to my older devices.\n\n\nCons\n\nOccasional UI Bugs: A slight stutter when switching rapidly between apps. \n\nNight-Mode on people's faces: Waxy skin tones in some indoor shots of people.\n\nMinor UI Changes: New icon styles was off-putting at first.\n\nSpotify Controls: Need two swipes down in Quick Panel to skip or change tracks.\n\n\n\nFull review after 24 Hours:\n \n---\nDisplay\n\nThe S25 Ultra\u2019s display is absolutely mesmerizing. It\u2019s pin-sharp, with vivid colors and plenty of brightness for outdoor use. The anti-reflective coating is a noticeable upgrade, even with a screen protector applied will satisfy 99% of users.\n\n---\nPerformance\n\nCompared directly to my S23 and a relatives iPhone 15 Pro Max, the S25 Ultra feels astonishingly smooth. Samsung has finally fixed animations to near perfection \u2014 transitions are swift and fluid, with only the occasional hiccup if I\u2019m switching in and out of multiple apps at lightning speed (something most users won\u2019t do often).\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the S23 or older models, you\u2019ll notice a considerable jump in perceived speed. Animations are much smoother and faster, and everything just \u201csnaps\u201d into place. It also feels, for the first time (in my experience), smoother than an iPhone in general day-to-day scrolling and app switching.\n\n\n---\nBattery Life &amp; Charging\n\nBattery life is phenomenal. In my experience, it easily lasts through a day of moderate or even heavy use. I\u2019m seeing 2\u20134 more hours of screen-on time compared to my S23, hitting about 7\u20139 hours SOT total on a single charge.\n\nWith a 45W fast charger, the S25 Ultra charges from around 20% to 60% in about 15 minutes. I\u2019m not sure why some reviewers complain about charging speeds\u2014this is plenty fast for real-world and most users usage.\n\n\n---\n\nCamera Performance\n\nOutdoor Photos\n\nDetailed shots with vibrant colors and impressive dynamic range.\n\nZoom capabilities are strong, and lens switching is noticeably smoother than before.\n\n\nIndoor &amp; Low Light\n\nNight mode sometimes results in faces looking waxy, as if over-processed.\n\nOverall Video quality has improved significantly\u2014 closest to the iPhone as Samsung's have ever been.\n\nOverall very versatile camera system that should remain competitive for many years to come.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSoftware &amp; One UI 7\n\nI had initial doubts and annoyances about One UI 7\u2019s redesigned icons and UI tweaks, but they grew on me after some use (Mostly the quick, fluid animations Lmao). Only annoyance so far is controlling Spotify from the notification panel; you need to swipe down twice to skip or adjust tracks, which interrupts  the music experience a bit.\n\n\n---\n\nSpeakers &amp; Audio Quality\n\nI skipped the S24 series because they are known for their tinny/downgraded speakers compared to the S23 lineup. By contrast, the S25 Ultra\u2019s speakers are excellent\u2014especially once Dolby Atmos is enabled and the EQ is set to \u201cDynamic.\u201d The audio is louder, richer, and carries more bass than the S23. I usually only need 20ish% volume for social media videos and 50ish\u201370% for enjoying music. Distortion at high volumes is minimal, placing these speakers among the top flagships.\n\n\n---\n\nThermals &amp; Heat Management\n\nThermals are a pleasant surprise. On 5G, the phone stays noticeably cooler than my S23 or iPhone. It only gets  warm during heavy tasks like large downloads or intense gaming sessions, which is expected. Turning on the \u201cLight Performance Profile\u201d reduced heat further, making extended heavy usage more comfortable.\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I consider the S25 Ultra well worth the cost of roughly $1000 CAD with trade in. It addresses nearly every complaint I had with older Samsung models\u2014faster performance/animations, better battery life, improved cameras, and the best SAMSUNG speakers in recent memory. Minor UI quirks aside, this is a 9/10 phone, and with a few software updates hopefully fixing the small bugs, it could easily reach 9.5/10 for me. If you\u2019re coming from an S23 (or older), this upgrade is surprisingly substantial.\nTop comments:\n1. &gt; Spotify Controls: Need two swipes down in Quick Panel to skip or change tracks.\n\nI'm assuming you've changed your notifications/quick panel to 'together'? As using the default setup you only have to swipe once to get to media player\n2. Even coming from the S24 Ultra, this feels like a major upgrade. All the screen issues with the 24 have been fixed. The speakers are an incredible upgrade. So much louder and clearer. It's faster. The UI feels new but familiar. Really the only thing I miss is swiping up from the corner for the assistant and the Bluetooth s-pen. Not that I used it much, but it came in handy for taking group photos.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ifilia/s25_ultra_review_after_24_hours/\n\n",
            "Chunk 16:\nTitle: S24 Ultra: One year later\nSelftext: One year later, I'm enjoying this beast!

            "Chunk 17:\nTitle: S24 Ultra Dull Display \u2010 Definitive Post\nSelftext: The patch is out and....\n\nIt does resolve the display colours issue to a point. The vividness slider definitely makes stuff pop more but it's not enough....\n\nOpen Instagram and slide down the notifications area and you'll get the colours and bright whites you're used to.\n\nIt's like apps can turn HDR on but the ui doesn't use it. If you do the Instagram notification thing and see it's bright. Then close Instagram and as fast as possible pull down the notification area. You'll see that it fades back to looking dull over about a second. It was my boss that pointed this out and I was easily able to replicate it. \n\nI do not know what Samsung are playing at. They give us this amazing display but no option to have it look as good as it can. \n\nSigh.\n\n\nEdit 7. As per the link below. Samsung are providing a fix without actually admitting they fucked up. Telling us that the display is tuned differently ignores that natural vs vivid yields zero difference. But they make it seem like it's a user choice thing that they weren't expecting. Do these companies think people are stupid enough to believe this horseshit?\n\nAt least a fix is coming.\n\nhttps://www.samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/samsung-announces-galaxy-s24-series-update-offering-galaxy-users-more-choices/\n\n\nHi All,\n\nI wanted to try to get together an aggregate post to bring the state of the display to their attention.\n\nOn the homescreen or app drawer the colours are awful. But put content on and it's great.\n\nI did a side by side with my S22 Ultra and when playing videos or in apps the S24 is brilliant but on the homescreen it's hot garbage.\n\nIt appears to be software not hardware which you can see by...\n\nPull down the notification area and you'll see it's all dull.\nOpen Instagram and a comments section.\nThen pull down the notification area and you'll see that the area looks as you'd expect.\n\nI don't think it's anything to do with the glass or the screen as some assert. I think it's a stupid software glitch.\n\nAlso Samsung for the love of all that is holy, give us some real options to adjust the display. 2 modes that are hardly any different is not enough. We need to be able to adjust brightness contrast saturation etc.\n\nEDIT...\n\nI think the issue is there's ZERO difference when you switch between vivid and natural.\n\nIt's like it's stuck on natural.\n\nChanging wallpaper does nothing.\nTurning off or on the adaptive stuff does nothing.\nIf you try to adjust colour temp or the individual colour sliders.. it does nothing.\n\nI've asked 2 colleagues about their experiences and theirs are identical.\n\nEdit 2...\n\nWHEN YOU WATCH CONTENT THE BLACKS ARE INKY THE COLOURS ARE VIBRANT. THIS IS IN THE UI. IT CANNOT BE HARDWARE. IT CANNOT BE THE GLASS. IT CANNOT BE THE COATING. IF IT WERE ANYTHING BUT SOFTWARE IT WOULDN'T LOOK AWESOME IN SOME CASES AND BAD IN OTHERS.\n\nCapitalised because I am sick of people saying what about the blacks or it must be the screen. It is software. Fullstop. \n\nIt is also NOT BRIGHTNESS. It is DULL COLOURS.\n\n\nEdit 3...\n\nu/Encode_GR said and found the following.\n\nFor anyone who's interested. It appears that Samsung UK Support has acknowledged the issue, and already working on a fix, which will be released as an update or patch. Link's below, middle of the page.\n\nhttps://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s24-series/s24-ultra-washed-out-colours/td-p/9019030/page/27\n\n\nEdit 4....\n\nSomeone has offered a solution to Reset Settings. Myself and a few others have tried it. It does not work. Their own post is replete with people saying it doesn't work. Maybe a few will get lucky but it seems that if you have the issue it is VERY unlikely to resolve it.\n\nSorry.\n\nEdit 5.....\n\nAs confirmed in this video. IT IS NOT THE COATING. IT IS SOFTWARE.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rSkhC4AGhxg?si=aLkc9_b2-7aKj-R3\n\nEdit 6... from u/reekostory\n\nNot to sure how reliable this source is, but big if true\nhttps://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1755448365599637760?s=19\n\nTop comments:\n1.

            "Chunk 18:\nTitle: Why I Switched from Pixel 8 Pro to Galaxy S24 Ultra: My Honest 24-Hour Review\nSelftext: I purchased my Google Pixel 8 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB) last October. Yesterday, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Black, 512 GB). It's been 24 hours with the new device, so here\u2019s my honest experience:\n\n1. UI: The Pixel has a cleaner UI that feels faster but tends to stutter. Apps like Reddit, Twitter, and even some websites on Chrome lag while scrolling. The Pixel has good animations and responsive haptics. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's One UI is super smooth and feels more like a premium device. Scrolling is noticeably better\u2014on the Pixel 8 Pro, one swipe gets me about 11 posts down, while on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the same swipe moves through 20 posts. The Pixel UI feels tight, while One UI slides more fluidly. I used to think the Pixel UI was fast, but now I know what fast really is. It's like people saying 60Hz is fine until they experience 120Hz.\n\n2. Performance:  I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because of overheating issues with the Pixel 8 Pro. For example, one day, while trying to book a cab using multiple apps with mobile data and location on, the Pixel 8 Pro got extremely warm within 5 minutes. It became uncomfortable to hold, and when I took it out of my pocket, one of the cab apps had crashed, and the battery had drained by 10% in just 15-20 minutes. As a longtime Nexus and Pixel user, this was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how this phone is supposed to handle 7 years of software updates. \n\nAfter getting the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I transferred my data using Smart Switch, and it only got mildly warm during the setup. Once it was set up, the phone frame felt cool to the touch. Even after watching a YouTube video in 4K for 40 minutes, it didn\u2019t get warm at all. The device is snappy and feels like you\u2019re typing on a slab of glass, unlike the Pixel's velvety feeling. Also, the Pixel gets quite warm when charging with a 20W PD charger, which is not ideal.\n\n3. Battery: Battery life was another major reason for switching to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Pixel's battery tends to die on long workdays. Even with adaptive charging, by 7 PM, it\u2019s often down to 18% after moderate use. The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is inconsistent\u2014some weeks, it lasts all day, and other times, it struggles to make it through. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with Google\u2019s updates, but the battery performance seems to fluctuate.\n\nOn the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I charged it to 100% yesterday at 7 PM, and now, 23 hours later, it's still at 40%. I\u2019m confident it can easily last a whole day with heavy use. The battery management is impressive.\n\n4. Extras: I do miss the \"Best Take\" feature on the Pixel and the ability to take screenshots and copy text from the recent menu. However, Samsung\u2019s feature granularity is impressive. The S-Pen is decent; I expected it to be as good as the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s not quite there. Still, I enjoy the functionality of the stylus and the sound it makes when writing notes, like writing on coarse paper.\n\n5. Camera: The camera isn't my primary concern, which might be why I was able to switch away from the Pixel more easily. The Pixel\u2019s camera is excellent, producing very natural-looking photos. The Samsung camera is good for most situations but doesn\u2019t quite match the Pixel's photo processing quality. \n\nIn conclusion, the Pixel\u2019s UI is better and feels very user-friendly, but the Tensor G3 chip seems to hold it back. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers a superior experience, but you wouldn\u2019t realize this unless you use both phones for a while. For me, the ideal phone would have the UI and camera of the Pixel and the hardware of the Samsung. But that's a dream for another day.\nTop comments:\n1. One  UI 6.X+ is actually pretty great, and I just bought a P9PXL (canceled my Fold Order :( ). I've had a LOT of Samsung's over the years (Note 2, Note 4, S9+, S21 U, and S23U) and I really loved all of them. They're fast, One UI never bothered me (even what came before didn't bother me), and battery life has always been quite good.\n\nThe Pixel Camera did absolutely win me over with the P7P, but battery life and cellular reception were absolutely atrocious. I stuck with my P7P from launch until the S23U came out, and I was happier.\n\nThen I really started to miss the picture quality, and bought a P8P. Battery life wasn't as good as the S23U, but it routinely gets me through a day (hasn't failed yet), and while cellular reception still isn't great, it's better than the P7P. I did choose to trade in my P8P for a P9P XL after seeing battery drain tests that show battery life is on par with the S24U (if not better), and that cellular connectivity is also fantastic. \n\nThe Android world is absolutely a great place right now. The Flagships are all worth getting, and it's down to personal preference. You can't go wrong with either phone, the S24U is awesome. The P9P series is awesome. It's a great time to be an Android user!\n2. After 4 months, I couldn't stand the photos on the 24 ultra. The ones I took at a concert last week made it painfully obvious that the camera sucks at zoom and low light. So I now have a Pixel 9 pro xl. I've missed the camera and call screening. The battery and signal, so far, are as good or better than the 24 ultra.\n3. Came from the S24u to the Pixel 9P XL. I don't understand all the reviews telling the UI is buttery. It's not. I don't think it is because of the CPU power itself. It's plenty powerful for UI animations etc.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1f1n4qo/why_i_switched_from_pixel_8_pro_to_galaxy_s24/\n\n",

Bit surprised he calls it a positive thing that these AI features will cost money via a subscription fee in 2025. I absolutely hate that. Everything is being locked away as DLCs and subscriptions. You can no longer buy a complete package\n\nAnd I honestly fear what it could lead to, if it ends up being a succes.. something like the fastest 5G band being locked unless you have that subscription plan?\n2.  I think this phone needs to be seen from the perspective of someone who owns an S21U or S22U. Upgrading from an S23U, like most year to year upgrades, doesn't make any sense. I upgraded from the Exynos S21U to the S23U last year and the difference in battery life alone was worth it, especially since I am a frequent traveler. If indeed the 24U has better battery life, then it's a worthy upgrade for S21U and S22U users IMHO.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1absdd7/samsung_s24_ultra_review_galaxy_brain_mrmobile/\n\n",

In low light handheld the s24 ultra may win since you can use a faster shutter speed / lower iso as it has a larger aperture. \n\nIn the end it doesn't matter. The differences aren't huge. If you have an s23 ultra don't upgrade to the s24 ultra ( unless its like a few hundred difference) unless you really want that 5x zoom. Wait for the s25. Your trade in value will probably be the same and the phone will cost the same as the s24 ultra.\n2. I do use 10x a lot\n3.

            "Chunk 6:\nTitle: S25 Ultra Review After 24 Hours\nSelftext: \nI recently upgraded to the S25 Ultra from my Galaxy S23, despite many reviewers claiming upgrades were only worthwhile from the S22 Ultra or older. After using it fairly extensively the past 24 ish hours, I can confidently say this phone feels like a remarkable and well worth leap forward.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros\n\nStunning Display: Pin-sharp, vivid, and impressively bright.\n\nHigh Performance: Blazing-fast animations, feels smoother than both the S23 and FINALLY iPhone 15 Pro Max/ iPhone's in general.\n\nExcellent Battery: 2\u20134 hours more screen-on time than my S23.\n\nImpressive Camera Setup: Great outdoor detail, smooth lens switching, solid video quality.\n\nImproved Speakers: Loud and bass-rich, especially with Dolby Atmos and Dynamic preset on.\n\nCooler Thermals: Barely heats up on 5G and normal usage compared to my older devices.\n\n\nCons\n\nOccasional UI Bugs: A slight stutter when switching rapidly between apps. \n\nNight-Mode on people's faces: Waxy skin tones in some indoor shots of people.\n\nMinor UI Changes: New icon styles was off-putting at first.\n\nSpotify Controls: Need two swipes down in Quick Panel to skip or change tracks.\n\n\n\nFull review after 24 Hours:\n \n---\nDisplay\n\nThe S25 Ultra\u2019s display is absolutely mesmerizing. It\u2019s pin-sharp, with vivid colors and plenty of brightness for outdoor use. The anti-reflective coating is a noticeable upgrade, even with a screen protector applied will satisfy 99% of users.\n\n---\nPerformance\n\nCompared directly to my S23 and a relatives iPhone 15 Pro Max, the S25 Ultra feels astonishingly smooth. Samsung has finally fixed animations to near perfection \u2014 transitions are swift and fluid, with only the occasional hiccup if I\u2019m switching in and out of multiple apps at lightning speed (something most users won\u2019t do often).\n\nIf you\u2019ve used the S23 or older models, you\u2019ll notice a considerable jump in perceived speed. Animations are much smoother and faster, and everything just \u201csnaps\u201d into place. It also feels, for the first time (in my experience), smoother than an iPhone in general day-to-day scrolling and app switching.\n\n\n---\nBattery Life &amp; Charging\n\nBattery life is phenomenal. In my experience, it easily lasts through a day of moderate or even heavy use. I\u2019m seeing 2\u20134 more hours of screen-on time compared to my S23, hitting about 7\u20139 hours SOT total on a single charge.\n\nWith a 45W fast charger, the S25 Ultra charges from around 20% to 60% in about 15 minutes. I\u2019m not sure why some reviewers complain about charging speeds\u2014this is plenty fast for real-world and most users usage.\n\n\n---\n\nCamera Performance\n\nOutdoor Photos\n\nDetailed shots with vibrant colors and impressive dynamic range.\n\nZoom capabilities are strong, and lens switching is noticeably smoother than before.\n\n\nIndoor &amp; Low Light\n\nNight mode sometimes results in faces looking waxy, as if over-processed.\n\nOverall Video quality has improved significantly\u2014 closest to the iPhone as Samsung's have ever been.\n\nOverall very versatile camera system that should remain competitive for many years to come.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSoftware &amp; One UI 7\n\nI had initial doubts and annoyances about One UI 7\u2019s redesigned icons and UI tweaks, but they grew on me after some use (Mostly the quick, fluid animations Lmao). Only annoyance so far is controlling Spotify from the notification panel; you need to swipe down twice to skip or adjust tracks, which interrupts  the music experience a bit.\n\n\n---\n\nSpeakers &amp; Audio Quality\n\nI skipped the S24 series because they are known for their tinny/downgraded speakers compared to the S23 lineup. By contrast, the S25 Ultra\u2019s speakers are excellent\u2014especially once Dolby Atmos is enabled and the EQ is set to \u201cDynamic.\u201d The audio is louder, richer, and carries more bass than the S23. I usually only need 20ish% volume for social media videos and 50ish\u201370% for enjoying music. Distortion at high volumes is minimal, placing these speakers among the top flagships.\n\n\n---\n\nThermals &amp; Heat Management\n\nThermals are a pleasant surprise. On 5G, the phone stays noticeably cooler than my S23 or iPhone. It only gets  warm during heavy tasks like large downloads or intense gaming sessions, which is expected. Turning on the \u201cLight Performance Profile\u201d reduced heat further, making extended heavy usage more comfortable.\n\n\n---\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, I consider the S25 Ultra well worth the cost of roughly $1000 CAD with trade in. It addresses nearly every complaint I had with older Samsung models\u2014faster performance/animations, better battery life, improved cameras, and the best SAMSUNG speakers in recent memory. Minor UI quirks aside, this is a 9/10 phone, and with a few software updates hopefully fixing the small bugs, it could easily reach 9.5/10 for me. If you\u2019re coming from an S23 (or older), this upgrade is surprisingly substantial.\nTop comments:\n1. &gt; Spotify Controls: Need two swipes down in Quick Panel to skip or change tracks.\n\nI'm assuming you've changed your notifications/quick panel to 'together'? As using the default setup you only have to swipe once to get to media player\n2. Even coming from the S24 Ultra, this feels like a major upgrade. All the screen issues with the 24 have been fixed. The speakers are an incredible upgrade. So much louder and clearer. It's faster. The UI feels new but familiar. Really the only thing I miss is swiping up from the corner for the assistant and the Bluetooth s-pen. Not that I used it much, but it came in handy for taking group photos.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ifilia/s25_ultra_review_after_24_hours/\n\n",
            "Chunk 7:\nTitle: Why I Switched from Pixel 8 Pro to Galaxy S24 Ultra: My Honest 24-Hour Review\nSelftext: I purchased my Google Pixel 8 Pro (Obsidian, 128 GB) last October. Yesterday, I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Black, 512 GB). It's been 24 hours with the new device, so here\u2019s my honest experience:\n\n1. UI: The Pixel has a cleaner UI that feels faster but tends to stutter. Apps like Reddit, Twitter, and even some websites on Chrome lag while scrolling. The Pixel has good animations and responsive haptics. In contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra's One UI is super smooth and feels more like a premium device. Scrolling is noticeably better\u2014on the Pixel 8 Pro, one swipe gets me about 11 posts down, while on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the same swipe moves through 20 posts. The Pixel UI feels tight, while One UI slides more fluidly. I used to think the Pixel UI was fast, but now I know what fast really is. It's like people saying 60Hz is fine until they experience 120Hz.\n\n2. Performance:  I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra because of overheating issues with the Pixel 8 Pro. For example, one day, while trying to book a cab using multiple apps with mobile data and location on, the Pixel 8 Pro got extremely warm within 5 minutes. It became uncomfortable to hold, and when I took it out of my pocket, one of the cab apps had crashed, and the battery had drained by 10% in just 15-20 minutes. As a longtime Nexus and Pixel user, this was disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how this phone is supposed to handle 7 years of software updates. \n\nAfter getting the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I transferred my data using Smart Switch, and it only got mildly warm during the setup. Once it was set up, the phone frame felt cool to the touch. Even after watching a YouTube video in 4K for 40 minutes, it didn\u2019t get warm at all. The device is snappy and feels like you\u2019re typing on a slab of glass, unlike the Pixel's velvety feeling. Also, the Pixel gets quite warm when charging with a 20W PD charger, which is not ideal.\n\n3. Battery: Battery life was another major reason for switching to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The Pixel's battery tends to die on long workdays. Even with adaptive charging, by 7 PM, it\u2019s often down to 18% after moderate use. The battery life on the Pixel 8 Pro is inconsistent\u2014some weeks, it lasts all day, and other times, it struggles to make it through. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with Google\u2019s updates, but the battery performance seems to fluctuate.\n\nOn the Galaxy S24 Ultra, I charged it to 100% yesterday at 7 PM, and now, 23 hours later, it's still at 40%. I\u2019m confident it can easily last a whole day with heavy use. The battery management is impressive.\n\n4. Extras: I do miss the \"Best Take\" feature on the Pixel and the ability to take screenshots and copy text from the recent menu. However, Samsung\u2019s feature granularity is impressive. The S-Pen is decent; I expected it to be as good as the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s not quite there. Still, I enjoy the functionality of the stylus and the sound it makes when writing notes, like writing on coarse paper.\n\n5. Camera: The camera isn't my primary concern, which might be why I was able to switch away from the Pixel more easily. The Pixel\u2019s camera is excellent, producing very natural-looking photos. The Samsung camera is good for most situations but doesn\u2019t quite match the Pixel's photo processing quality. \n\nIn conclusion, the Pixel\u2019s UI is better and feels very user-friendly, but the Tensor G3 chip seems to hold it back. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra offers a superior experience, but you wouldn\u2019t realize this unless you use both phones for a while. For me, the ideal phone would have the UI and camera of the Pixel and the hardware of the Samsung. But that's a dream for another day.\nTop comments:\n1. One  UI 6.X+ is actually pretty great, and I just bought a P9PXL (canceled my Fold Order :( ). I've had a LOT of Samsung's over the years (Note 2, Note 4, S9+, S21 U, and S23U) and I really loved all of them. They're fast, One UI never bothered me (even what came before didn't bother me), and battery life has always been quite good.\n\nThe Pixel Camera did absolutely win me over with the P7P, but battery life and cellular reception were absolutely atrocious. I stuck with my P7P from launch until the S23U came out, and I was happier.\n\nThen I really started to miss the picture quality, and bought a P8P. Battery life wasn't as good as the S23U, but it routinely gets me through a day (hasn't failed yet), and while cellular reception still isn't great, it's better than the P7P. I did choose to trade in my P8P for a P9P XL after seeing battery drain tests that show battery life is on par with the S24U (if not better), and that cellular connectivity is also fantastic. \n\nThe Android world is absolutely a great place right now. The Flagships are all worth getting, and it's down to personal preference. You can't go wrong with either phone, the S24U is awesome. The P9P series is awesome. It's a great time to be an Android user!\n2. After 4 months, I couldn't stand the photos on the 24 ultra. The ones I took at a concert last week made it painfully obvious that the camera sucks at zoom and low light. So I now have a Pixel 9 pro xl. I've missed the camera and call screening. The battery and signal, so far, are as good or better than the 24 ultra.\n3. Came from the S24u to the Pixel 9P XL. I don't understand all the reviews telling the UI is buttery. It's not. I don't think it is because of the CPU power itself. It's plenty powerful for UI animations etc.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1f1n4qo/why_i_switched_from_pixel_8_pro_to_galaxy_s24/\n\n",

            "Chunk 9:\nTitle: S24 Ultra Failure\nSelftext: Hey all, \nJust gonna start by saying I've been a samsung fan boy for a long time and always preferred samsung over other brands, especially Apple. I've had multiple galaxy phones and I finally got the S24 ultra for black friday, my first flagship phone and I was super excited. \n\nBut, as the days went by I realized that not much has really changed with samsung phones. I had a note 20 and the 24 ultra honestly feels like the same phone but a little faster. Then more time when by am I started to see the issues with the S24 ultra. The S-pen feels super cheap compared to the notes pen, the camera isn't really that great (struggles with focus more than the note in certain lighting), the AI is just a gimmick that isn't used because it's a bit janky and not as smooth as shown in their demos (it's a glorified Google search/translate/whatever tool Google already has), bluetooth connectivity keeps getting dropped (never with my note 20 on the same devices) and now this junk wont charge because it detects moisture  in the port that isnt there. I Googled the moisture issue and I'm not the first one with this, its a known issue. For a flagship phone this is absolutely junk and an utter failure of a flagships first year on the market.\n\nI can't believe I am saying this but I actually regret getting this phone. My cousin got the IPhone 16 max pro the same day I got this and that thing is a beast. I'm so let down by samsung with this that I don't even know what to do. I kind wanna migrate to Apple because alteast they have some consistency with thier phones, sure they are all the same with limited improvements between generations but hey, their phones work and always deliver. \n\nYes, i will reach out to customer support in the morning but still I'm utterly let down by \"the best phone on the market\".\nTop comments:\n1. It's not like Apple introduces revolutionary changes to their phones every year either lol. You can switch now, but then as you upgrade to newer iPhones you'll notice the same thing as you do now with Samsung. But if you're a Samsung fan, there's plenty of functionalities you'll miss if you switch. \nI got an iPhone 13 as a company phone in a time when I owned S22+ (they're comparable phones as they came out in the same time). And surely the selfie quality was better on the 13, but there was just SO MUCH little stuff missing.. Like the back button inconsistency, no customization options like One Hand Operarion+, no clipboard in the keyboard, no long screenshots, having to change the notifications on every single app to change their voice/vibrarion... unless you want something very simple. Then go for it.\n2. Buyers remorse, eh?\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1i2hx2h/s24_ultra_failure/\n\n",
            "Chunk 10:\nTitle: I have pre-ordered every Samsung flagship for the past five years, but for the first time, I'm hesitating. Even owners of the S21 to S23 seem better off upgrading to the S24U at half the price to access 95% of the S25U features. They even downgraded the S-Pen... What a letdown.\nSelftext: It seems the upgrades to CPU, GPU, and efficiency are only marginal. And they did not implement any meaningful updates this time around.\n\nThe cameras still use outdated telephoto sensors, and there was no mention of addressing the main camera's biggest issue: shutter lag.\n\nThere is no increase in battery size, which raises the question of who asked for a slimmer phone. This means any improvement in battery life will only come from slight CPU efficiency gains.\n\n# Finally... AI.\n\nAs someone who relies heavily on AI in my daily life (using tools like Notebook LM, Perplexity, Windsurf, etc.), I had hoped for genuine advancements in AI. I was expecting at least an offline local LLM for privacy or much deeper integration of Galaxy AI, especially since the S24U implementation was lackluster. AI summarization was severely limited for long content, AI voice memos to text were poor, and Bixby Text Call was riddled with typos. Instead? we got ***more Gemini***, which continues to lag behind ChatGPT and Claude, even with their 1.5 Pro model. Seriously Samsung?\n\n# And the final disappointment?\n\nThey **downgraded the S-Pen.** It is no longer Bluetooth capable and has lost the remote shutter and air gestures, which were incredibly useful for photography. I often carry a pocket or mini tripod, and these features made navigation much easier with the S-Pen. And since they probably removed the wireless charger for the S-Pen, you can't even buy an old-gen bluetooth one since it won't ever charge.\n\nWhat a letdown.\n\n**The S-Pen downgrade alone makes the S25U feel like a S24U FE, What the F\\*ck Samsung.**\n\n**edit**: I guess I should at least thank Samsung for helping me break the cycle lol, maybe they'll actually loose enough sales to change. Though I'll admit if they remove the S-Pen for the S26U, I'm absolutely just buying an iPhone at that point.\n\n**edit:** people keep asking where it's half price. Samsung obviously keeps both S24U and S25U at MSRP on their site to fool people into thinking S25U is a better deal with trade in because idiots like myself fall for it. But due to the age, [S24U goes on sale frequently for $600-800 USD and is easy to catch setting up deal notifications](https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?q=s24+ultra+unlocked&amp;searcharea=deals&amp;searchin=first&amp;isUserSearch=1&amp;sort=relevance&amp;searchtype=normal). Even if you have a used S20-23/Plus/Ultra, you can probably sell it easily and finance a S24U for much less than a S25U. Don't fall for Samsung's shitty trade-in earbud deals.\nTop comments:\n1.

            "Chunk 12:\nTitle: A personal Dilemma: Galaxy S23 or Galaxy S24?\nSelftext: Howdy all! I'm coming here to crowdsource opinions on which phone to go with next.\n\nFor context; I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy Ao4s(typing this post on it), and I'm really not loving the frequent lag, stuttering, hitching, and just generally slow performance when I try to open a lot of my apps( Snapchat, Reddit, Instagram etc), and that's to say nothing of how leggy and hot the phone gets when I try to run any form of mobile game app. Even opening stuff like the Notes app, SMS messaging app, the Settings menu, the phone just struggles immensely, taking significant time to open and load anything, and I'm fed up of it. The 32GB storage just isn't cutting it for me either personally.\n\nI'd ideally like a new model with a Chipset that offers as close to lag-free performance during both basic operation, using and perusing social media, and even mobile gaming as i can get. \n\nI've been looking at some of the flagship S models(on contract), and the S23 and S24 in particular have caught my eye. I've seen the reviews, and both seem to be generally favourable models( the plus and Ultra versions of each are a hair out of my price range currently). \n\nThere's one other additional wrinkle too;\nI'm not in America currently, so both models would have Exynos chips in them instead of Qualcomm Snapdragon, and I've observed that Exynos' track record has been, uhhhhh, controversial, to say the least lol. Getting a phone shipped over from the US isn't an option for me atm either.\n\nSo with all this in mind, if anyone has any advice or possible insights on which model I should go with, that would be much appreciated, thank you in advance :)\nTop comments:\n1. S23 has the SD 8 gen 2 chip worldwide. The base S23, not the FE keep in mind. The FE has the chip from the S22 and thus inherits the bad thermals and battery life.\n2. Exynos shouldn't be a problem on the S24 but the S23 (which comes with snapdragon worldwide) is really just as good. Buy whichever's cheaper. Just make sure you don't buy the FE.\n3. Maybe you're mistaken. \nS23 comes with a snapdragon 8 gen 2 world wide. So it's an easy choice.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/1d46rmk/a_personal_dilemma_galaxy_s23_or_galaxy_s24/\n\n",

I upgraded from an S22 Ultra, and am surprised how much better the S24 Ultra works, feels, and looks.\n\nHowever, games like Pokemon GO constantly crash, often up to 7 times per hour. It's crashed so often that the operating system has asked that I put the game in Deep Sleep. I'd be happier if this was an isolated issue with my phone, but there are lots of reports on Reddit ([example](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=%22pokemon%20go%22%20s24&amp;t=month)), other forums, and social media.\n\nI have tried:\n\n* Force-closing the app\n* Restarting the phone\n* Clearing app cache\n* Clearing app storage\n* Formatting the phone\n* Installing the Galaxy Store version\n* Installing version within Secure Folder\n* Using and not using Game Booster, with various settings\n* Contacting Niantic, the developer of Pokemon GO\n\nIt seems like this may be a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 issue, as other recently-released phones with this SoC seem to have the same issue. The Pokemon GO game crashes at all times: idle on the home screen, battling in PvP, fighting in a raid, swiping through my storage items, looking through my Pokemon, and even clicking around in settings.\n\nMy return period will end in 2 days, and I guess I'll be returning this phone, unfortunately. If this one issue could be fixed, this $1,419.99 would have been worth it. I've spent over $200 on accessories (e.g., cases, MagSafe products) on the phone, and it's going to cost me some money to return them, so that will be a waste of time and money.\n\nIf anyone has thoughts about this, please do share. If you are also experiencing this issue, please post a comment - even a simple one - so others are aware of how widespread this issue may be. Thank you and take care.\nTop comments:\n1. I don't think it has anything to do with the phone I think the games need to be updated or fixed so it can run well on the phone.\n2.

            "Chunk 16:\nTitle: My thoughts on Galaxy S25 Ultra after using it for 3 days\nSelftext: I pre-ordered the S25 Ultra (Jet Black, 512GB) a couple of weeks ago and received it three days back.\n\n**Reviews &amp; Reception**\n\nReviews have been harsh on this phone, and Apple is facing similar backlash for iOS 18 &amp; Apple Intelligence.\n\nFor the first time, both brands are facing heavy criticism, not just from critics but also from loyal fans. This is a good thing\u2014it reminds them not to take customer loyalty for granted and hopefully pushes them to rethink their next flagship models.\n\n**My Thoughts**\n\nMany criticisms are valid:\n\n* Missing S Pen features\n* No 6000mAh battery\n* Still using an 8-bit display\n* Lack of fast charging\n* Poor Stability Scores of Snapdragon Elite\n* No IP69 rating\n* Camera Shutter lag\n\nIf you consider category comparisons:\n\n* **Best Display:**\u00a0OnePlus 13 (10-bit, much better PWM, etc.)\n* **Best Battery:**\u00a0S25 Ultra &amp; iPhone 16 Pro Max (very close); OnePlus 13 for fast charging\n* **Best Camera:**\u00a0Vivo X200 Pro &amp; Pixel 9 Pro\n* **Best Processor:**\u00a0S25 Ultra (Power) &amp; iPhone 16 Pro Max (Stability)\n* **Best Network:**\u00a0OnePlus 13 supports 5.5 G\n* **Best Software**: Pixel Series for Vanilla Android &amp; Fast Updates\n\nNeither the S25 Ultra nor the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best in most of the categories. But if someone asks, \"What's the best flagship right now?\" my answer is still one of these two. Why? As a complete package, they remain unbeatable.\n\nIn my experience, nothing about the S25 Ultra stood out as extraordinary or mind-blowing. Honestly, it felt boring\u2014but in a good way. It simply ticks all the boxes I expect from a flagship smartphone.\n\nIf someone asks me \"Which is the 2nd best flagship?\", I would immediately say S24 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Yes, phones like OnePlus 13, Vivo X200 Pro etc. are amazing but they don't tick all the checkboxes like Apple &amp; Samsung. That's the problem. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCritics and Reddit community can continue listing reasons why Apple and Samsung are falling behind. While their points are valid, the truth is that no other phones come close to these two in the premium segment. As a complete package, they remain unbeatable.\n\nIn simple terms \u2014 if you want the latest &amp; greatest Android flagship, go for the S25 Ultra! and if you want the latest &amp; greatest iOS flagship, go for iPhone 16 Pro Max\nTop comments:\n1. I was the biggest critic of the move to nerf the S Pen. I however think, this is just going to play like the headphone jack.\n2. This post doesn't feel like a usage review. More like a stats page with thoughts on other devices. I don't entirely disagree with expressed views. Just doesn't match the title. \n\nMy personal experience so far. \n\nBoth me and my wife pre-ordered our s25 ultras. Her battery for the first two days was horrific! We almost returned the phone. But on the third day. It miraculously improved. Mine has been decent. Feels about the same as the s24 ultra when it was new. The iPhone still lasts longer. Especially in standby mode. \n\nOther than that. The new shape or the phone, which people feel isn't different enough from the past generations, at least to look at, actually feels amazing in the hand. It's a significant improvement. Doesn't dig into the fingers. I use all my phones without a case or screen protectors. It feels lighter than my iPhone 16 pro max. Maybe it's the balance of the phone. I know the actual figures are close. \n\nHaven't really tested the camera out. But it's fine. No complaints. The shutter speed has definitely improved. For someone who uses the iPhone along with android, this would always stick out like a sore thumb. Camera results are okay. Both take decent pictures. \n\nAnyone have specific questions, I'm happy to answer.\n3.

            "Chunk 18:\nTitle: S25 Ultra review from a long-term Galaxy user\nSelftext: I received my S25 Ultra pre-order two days ago. I work in IT and am sort of a tech geek at the same time. I've had the original EU-version Galaxy S series, then the S4, the S7 Edge, the S9+ and then from S20 Ultra (included) onward, I've had all Ultra phones with the exception of S24 Ultra. I've also used a lot of iPhones on a pretty much daily basis due to work, I've used an iPhone as a beater phone if my Samsung's in for service and my girlfriend also has an iPhone (15 Pro Max currently).\n\nTo be honest, I never really wanted to upgrade from the S23 Ultra. I don't give much credit to the \"smartphone excitement weaning off\" propaganda. In my opinion, there's been zero to no excitement for years, we hit an innovation plateau a long time ago. I upgraded on an yearly basis simply because the previous phone was flawed enough. S20U couldn't focus and was extremely ugly, S21U had an unimpressive chipset and battery life, turns out S22U was even worse. S23U was the phone that seemingly fixed everything, apart from the OCD-inducing uneven bezels that somehow got even slightly worse. On paper, it was worse than even the S24U to S25U upgrade, and everyone on the internet complained, but to me, simply because of this Snapdragon chipset, it was the largest smartphone upgrade that I've had in years. S24U tempted me not one bit. However, seeing how my S23U got a burn in that got serviced and fixed in the last few days of the 2-year warranty period, I just wouldn't risk it so I purchased the S25U, so I can sell the S23U still in a good condition.\n\nSo far, the phone has been pretty great...\n\n**Positives**\n\n* Battery life seems to be just a tad bit better than the S23U which is fine by me, as the S23U was pretty great. I've been traveling a lot lately, having a power bank, just in case, and I never got to use it, not even once. My S23U and my Galaxy Watch 6 Classic have more often than not out-endured my girlfriend's iPhone 15 Pro Max and Apple Watch 7, especially in their respective low power modes on very long trips.\n* After so many years of curved screens, I was conditioned to associate a curved screen with a premium feeling. I was very skeptical seeing the S24U and, especially, the S25U. I've absolutely never had any practical issues with the curvature, even back in the days of the S7 Edge when it was far more pronounced than, say, the S23U's. However, I really like the design of the S25U, even though it's quite a bit iPhone-y. It somehow feels more premium than before and after a bit of self-reflection, I figured that back in the day, the only somewhat bezelless phones (at least on the sides, that is) were the ones with the curved screens, and now that we've reached a point where there are barely any bezels, even a flat screen can achieve this and feel premium and \"expensive\". I'm really OCD-happy about the bezel symmetry, as minor and unimpactful as that fact might really be. Also, I never realized that I missed the rounded off corners but turns out I did - I prefer them, definitely, but only looks-wise, I had no practical issues with the squared off ones either.\n* The screen quality is a bit of a weird one. I'll touch a bit on it in the negatives but overall it feels like the image the screen is displaying is more \"pure\", in a sense. Some may call it washed out but I definitely don't feel like this. This \"purity\" is somewhat present throughout the whole device too. It feels good, especially after I cranked up the vibrancy setting to the maximum. Glad to see that the QC is also on point, as I haven't had a blue/red-shifting OLED screen from Samsung in quite a while, unlike back in the day. I really enjoy the Extra Brightness setting (probably that's why I get a burn in of the status bar literally every year), and this time, due to images also appearing in HDR, it seems to be even a bit brighter and more impactful than before. The screen coating is also very good, thus the lack of screen protector on my phone, although I haven't tested it on a really sunny day yet. I expected it to feel like a matte screen, which I would not be happy about, but that's not the case.\n* Ironically, the biggest change I can see are the speakers, and barely any reviewer mentions them. They're a ton louder (even louder than the 15 Pro Max, which was quite a bit louder than the S23U) and a lot \"purer\" in sound (see, this \"purity\" thing keeps popping up). The new dialogue booster is also quite fun for YouTube videos and I will probably try to even keep it on for listening to music (via headphones too) as well, to see how it goes.\n* The camera is alright. I definitely need to test more but there's nothing that jumps at me as being bad. It feels like the Chinese are really pushing the hardware, yet I still prefer the Samsung's pictures and videos, no matter how I spin it. While the iPhone's rendition is a bit soulless to me, however, it seems like it's left Samsung a bit in the dust, especially when you pixel-peep a bit. However, due to the color output, I'd still take the Samsung's camera any day. S23U got pretty bad at night shots and people's skin tones over the updates, for some reason, and I'm glad to see an improvement on those fronts. I need to test it more to cement my opinion and, of course, a lot might change with updates in the upcoming months. All I can see is that the output is a lot more \"pure\" and closer to real life than before, while still maintaining the nice colors and vibrancy that the iPhone often lacks. It's the perfect combination for me, in terms of rendition.\n* The performance is great but it has been so ever since the Snapdragon on the S23U. The phone got a bit hot during the initial setup, as usual, but trying out a few games, it dimmed later than the S23U, not as much and felt less hot to the touch, which is an improvement for sure. Still, the bragging rights that the phone is now not only faster in GPU performance (which has been the case for a while now), but also in CPU multicore, at least on benchmarks, is a bit cool. I enjoy competition, especially when it's finally pretty close.\n* OneUI 7 feels great. I know it resembles iOS quite a lot but it managed to take just the good things and improve on them. It's not like iOS has not been doing the same thing those last few years. Having daily exposure to iOS, I do not enjoy it with a passion (even though I prefer MacOS to Windows by far), and seeing how OneUI Android is managing to improve even further (and I already liked it a lot) warms my heart.\n\n**Neutrals**\n\n* On a hardware level, the phone feels lacking. Seeing all those Chinese phones advancing it further and further, makes me feel a bit bad. However, when it comes to real life usage, due to the software on top of the hardware, there's not a single Chinese phone that tempts me, even a slight bit. Even when the Honor Magic 7 Pro was so discounted and was half the price of the S25U it didn't feel like a viable alternative to me.\n* Talking about hardware, the charging speed is still 45W. However, I've never felt like I need it any faster. Even when I've forgotten to charge my phone, I'd just hook it up in the last 10 minutes before me going out, and then the car's wireless charger would do the rest. And now it seems to be making even more use of those 45W and charges a bit faster, almost on par with some 60W+ phones. Not really a real-life issue for me, although on paper I still feel a bit left out.\n* The S Pen bluetooth omission. Sure, it feels bad to have something removed, but I really do believe that not a lot of people used those features, so that's why Samsung decided to cheap out a bit. I've now had an S Pen for 3 years and I used this feature just once. And a lot of the people around me share my usage numbers. If I need this again, I still have my watch, so I won't really miss it, for sure.\n\n**Negatives**\n\n* The display is still 8bit for some reason. Generally, this is almost a \"neutral\" for me, but yesterday I was comparing the S25U to the 15 Pro Max and in Tidal, for example, while playing a song there's a gradient at the bottom of the screen. On the 15 Pro Max it's perfect and the S25U completely botches it. It's a minor thing, for those rare gradient occasions, but still... come on...\n* The new speakers' dialogue clearness, overall purity and volume level, makes every little sound imperfection (or someone gulping while talking, for one) very noticeable. Initially I thought there's something wrong with my speakers but I compared it to other S25Us and it's pretty much the same there too. Also, even though those speakers are louder than the 15 Pro Max's, when comparing the two phones' sound quality in lossless music, the iPhone's overall quality feels better (highs, mids, bass, everything), so I can only imagine what the larger 16 Pro Max is like.\n* The video capture is improved but still feels lacking, compared to an iPhone.\n* Even though OneUI 7 feels amazing, it's still a bit buggy. Closing all apps from the app drawer often times does not close them at all and just dismisses the drawer, there are some weird random animation skips, and accidentally double tapping into something seems almost too easy. I hope they flesh those out in the upcoming large update.\n* AI. Honestly, most of it, if not all, is completely useless to me. And I even work professionally with it in IT. 90% of the marketing around the phone and a majority of the interface revolving around it while it's still more of a buzzword than an actual \"life companion\" is bizarre to me and simply aggravates me.\n* Lastly, all official Samsung cases feel like crap (sorry for the expression but I really do think it). S22U and S23U had those absolutely perfect leather cases, and now when I touched the new fake leather case for 60 euro, I was absolutely disgusted. Feels like a rough bad-quality plastic more so than actual leather. I'm all in for real leather but I've seen some pretty convincing fake leather lately, especially in cars and home furniture. Why can't the same manufacturing techniques and materials be applied to phone cases? Anyway... While waiting for my dbrand (first time trying out a case from them) I picked up a Samsung silicone case in black and it's just on the verge of alright, although their definition of black is more towards a blue-ish gray for some reason.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Turned out to be quite long but I wanted to leave my thoughts somewhere if they turn out to be useful to someone.\nTop comments:\n1. Received my S25U yesterday, coming from S23U.\n\n\nHere are my quick thoughts based on few hour usage which mostly was spent on device setup.\n\n\n- I always use adaptive brigthness, and with that option turned on in both phones, the S25U screen is dimmer. Just like an algorithm for calculating current brigthness has some negative offset for brigthness level compared to S23U.\n\n\n- Kindsuit \"leather\" case feels more artificial, plastic-like compared with S23U and S21U leather cases, which I expected. It's not that bad, but I still would prefer genuine leather. The most annoying thing about the case is that camera lenses are on the same level as the metal frame which is surrounding them. That makes me worry about carelessly putting my phone on the table.\n\n\n- I did not have much time for camera comparisons, but I noticed that images from S25U take less space. It doesn't have to mean anything, but its logical way of thinking is smaller size -&gt; potentialy lesser amount of information stored. Another thing I noticed that images are darker overall, at least when there is not that much of light.\n\n\n- Speakers seem to be louder, which is not always the case with new Galaxy devices\n\n\n- Nothing to say about battery life yet, but while using smart switch for data transfer (~150GB), there was not that big of a difference in battery usage in both phones.\n\n\n- I like OneUI 7 so far\n\n\n- In basic tasks like web browsing, the phone feels snappier\n\n\n- Fingerprint sensor works even better/faster\n\n\n- I still don't care about AI stuff\n2. Regarding the \"washed out\" screen, try turning off Eye Comfort Shield and Adaptive Color Tone, then go into Screen Mode, set it to vivid, and you should now have an advanced option. This option isn't there if those two are turned on. Under advanced you can turn up the vividness, and it seems to carry over when you turn the first two options back on. It's made my display feel much more like my S22U.\nSource: https://www.reddit.com/r/S25Ultra/comments/1ii83bx/s25_ultra_review_from_a_longterm_galaxy_user/\n\n",
